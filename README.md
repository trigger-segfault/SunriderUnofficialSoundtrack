# SUNRIDER: Unofficial Soundtrack

Scripts and guides for ID'ing, gathering, and compiling the soundtracks for all Sunrider Games into albums.

### See [TRACKS.md](TRACKS.md) for a list of all currently documented and ID'ed tracks/sources

⚠️ **Important:** Documentation filenames are still likely to change this early on, so it is recommended to keep a link to the root repository [trigger-segfault/SunriderUnofficialSoundtrack](https://github.com/trigger-segfault/SunriderUnofficialSoundtrack) instead of specific files contained within.


## TODO

#### Meta

- [ ] Create dedicated repository `TODO.md` list file.
- [ ] Improve table formatting to reduce excessive column word-wrapping.
- [ ] Split TRACKS.md into two files:
  - [ ] A List of game filenames ID'ed to song titles and artists.
  - [ ] A List of song titles and artists with additional metadata and sources to obtain said tracks.
- [ ] Determine best method for documenting track's with Japanese metadata and their translations.

#### Documentation

- [ ] Legend for icons and game tags such as <kbd>MoA</kbd>, <kbd>LD</kbd>, <kbd>SA</kbd>, <kbd>FA</kbd>, and <kbd>unused</kbd>.
- [ ] Finish and upload write-ups for each track source and how its used and functions.
- [ ] Collect and list all Epic Soul Factory tracks. <sup>(for Archived Jamendo and Bandcamp)</sup>
- [ ] Collect and list all Sunrider Academy tracks and sources. <sup>(pretty much all from Amacha Music)</sup>
- [ ] Collect and list all vocals OP/ED tracks and inserts/bonus tracks.
- [ ] Create list of commonly mispelled track names. <sup>(such as "Overpower**ed**", "Posthumus Reg**n**um" (not "Reg**i**um"), etc.)</sup>
- [ ] Upload compiled list of track appearance orders for each game.
- [ ] Confirm all track filename, title, artist, and URL accuracies. <sup>(such as spelling, casing, and game tags)</sup>
- [ ] Trivia documentation. <sup>(there's actually quite a lot of interesting tidbits)</sup>

#### Scripting

- [ ] Finish and commit scripts for compiling downloaded tracks into albums based on the users' desired configuration.
- [ ] Upload current list of hand-picked track ordering for First Arrival, Mask of Arcadius, and Liberation Day soundtracks.

#### Art Assets

- [x] Upload small icons used for documentation sources.
- [ ] Upload files and `.pdn`'s that may be used for soundtrack album covers.
